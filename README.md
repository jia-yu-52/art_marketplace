**Objective:** Using SQL to aid an online marketplace in enhancing user experience and increasing its revenue.

**Source:** 'Art Market Dataset: Selling Paintings Prediction' uploaded by Mojgan Taheri on Kaggle. 
This dataset includes 2,500 records of paintings sold on an online art marketplace and the link to the website
is as detailed: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jijagallery/art-market-dataset-selling-paintings-prediction.
    
**Methodology:** With the dataset, I created a 3NF relational database with the tables as follows:
1. painter: Contains description of the painters, mainly their names
2. artwork_description: Includes description of every artwork, such as its style and medium
3. artwork_sale: Stores information regarding the sale of an artwork, including its price and shipment method
4. target_audience: Lists target audiences of every artwork
These tables can be found in the database file.

Afterwards, several queries were conducted based on the database and recommendations were given on how the online art
marketplace can enhance its user experience and boost revenue. The specifics can be found in the SQL script file.
